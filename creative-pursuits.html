      <h1>Jim's Creative Pursuits</h1>

      <p>
        This is a space where I showcase my creative pursuits in photography, digital art, and
        music. Hopefully, you enjoy them! :D

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <img src="https://i.redd.it/1i4irstkhbm21.jpg"
        alt="Photo of a sunset amidst the UW Monoliths and another building.">
      <p>
        The above image was the image that I posted myself on Reddit nearly two years ago!
        I just rented a camera kit from UW STLP, and found an opportunity to take this image
        on the 8th floor of McMahon Hall in my freshman year.

      <img src="https://i.redd.it/s4wei765cei21.jpg"
        alt="Panoramic image of the Quad with the clear blue sky and sunlight shining through">
      <p>
        This was also the image I posted onto Reddit. I took this panoramic image in my freshman
        year! The sky was SO nice and there is not a lot of people on the quad too.

      <h2>Digital Art</h2>
      <img src="img/multiple-me.jpg"
        alt="Image of 11 versions of Jim performing various kinds of actions in a lounge room.">
      <p>
        I took the images myself in CSE Undergraduate lounge on Jan 1 2020, when no
        one was there. I made this stacked image in GIMP.
      </p>

      <img src="img/skyscraper-sketch.jpg"
        alt="This is a sketch-style image of a Bangkok skyline full with skyscrapers.">
      <p>
        I originally took this image in one Bangkok skyscraper, and I processed it using
        a self-made image manipulator program.

        I composed the song and have it recorded through Musescore! This is probably the
        first song ever that I felt confident in sharing.
