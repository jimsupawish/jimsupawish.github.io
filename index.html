      <h2>Work Experiences</h2>
      <h3>CSE Teaching Assistant</h3>  
      <p>Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</p>
      <p>2020 - Present</p>
      <p>
        This is my current job. I get to help and support students learning a variety of Computer Science courses
        and I learn something new every quarter I was a TA for.
      </p>
      <h3>Software Engineer Intern</h3>
      <p>LINE MAN Wongnai</p>
      <p>Summer 2021</p>
      <p>
        This is my internship in the field of Computer Science, and it broadens my mind on the framework that
        the real industry uses (as opposed to school). I am proud of the impacts that I made here.
      </p>
      <h3>Math Study Center Tutor</h3>
      <p>University of Washington</p>
      <p>2019 - 2020</p>
      <p>
        This is my first job ever, but I enjoy it a lot. I get to help students with Calculus problems, sometimes
        using visualization tools like <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">Desmos</a> to aid in explanation.
